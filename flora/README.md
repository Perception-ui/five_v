DATA DRIVEN SOLUTIONS FOR AGRICULTURE IN KENYA
As an agricultural consultancy firm.

Project Overview: Agriculture plays a pivotal role in Kenya from how it affects the economy to the day to day lives of Kenyans. However, there is a lack of informed decision making when it comes to the agricultural approach farmers take. This project has come about to address this gap by providing data driven agricultural approach addressing which crops should be planted in which regions, what agricultural practices to use for the different crops in the different regions and to include the market analysis for the crops to predict market trends for agricultural produce.
