NFTInsight: Decoding NFTs through Event Logs for Price Forecasting

Project Overview:
Incite aims to leverage supervised machine learning techniques to forecast price movements and volatility of NFTs. NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens) emerged as a unique asset class within the digital space, and understanding the factors influencing their pricing can provide valuable insights for creators, investors and enthusiasts.
Key Components:
- Data: The inputs to our model will include event logs from NFT projects.
  
- Target: The target variable is the future price of NFTs. Realistically, in a context where the above features are known, predicting future prices serves as a valuable unknown, enabling proactive decision-making.

- Rationale: - optimize  portfolios, creators tracking events on their projects, and enthusiasts gauging the market sentiment. 
The model's accuracy is crucial, as even small improvements in forecasting can translate into significant advantages in the dynamic and competitive NFT space.
